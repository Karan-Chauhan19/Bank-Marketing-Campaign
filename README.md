# Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction
This project uses a dataset collected from a bank's marketing campaign. The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not, based on various customer attributes and past campaign details.

# Overview
Banks often run marketing campaigns to encourage customers to subscribe to specific financial products, such as term deposits. By analyzing data from past campaigns, this project aims to:

    1. Understand customer behavior and preferences.
    2. Build a predictive model to identify potential customers likely to subscribe.
    3. Optimize future marketing campaigns for better results.
